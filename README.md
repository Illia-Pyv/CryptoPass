# Before you proceed
You will need to have Java 16 installed on your computer and set is as an environment variable. There are plenty of tutorials on that online.

# Download
To download CryptoPass, go to releases on the right and then select the latest release.
1. Now download the CryptoPass.zip (You don't need those other two files they are for the source code).

2. Go to where you installed the .zip folder and extract it.

3. When extracted you will see three files:
   - The .jar file is the executable one
   - The setup.bat sets up CryptoPass for you to be ready to work. It moves your files to the %userprofile%
     into a folder called CryptoPass. It also creates a shortcut on your desktop and sets a Hotkey for it.
     
     HotKey: CTRL + SHIFT + P
     
   - The uninstall.bat is pretty self-explanatory innit?
     But note that uninstall.bat only works if you have set it up with setup.bat before.
     
# And now have fun with CryptoPass!!!
