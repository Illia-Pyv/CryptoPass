It seems that you have found your own UUPK.
It is strongly recommended not to delete the file or your UUPK,
as it will resolve in the loss of passwords (Unless you wrote your UUPK down and you can sign in.).
It's also not recommended to change even one character of your password key,
as it will change your passwords completely.
